The Student Registration Form is a user-friendly online application that collects essential information from prospective students for enrollment purposes. It requests details like the student's full name, image, skills, website link, and mailid. After completing the form, students can simply click "Submit," and their entered details will be displayed on the same webpage for them to review and verify the accuracy of the information. This streamlined process ensures a smooth and efficient registration experience, making it easier for students to apply for admission to the institution.
